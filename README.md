Keyzen - Miniryoku Edition
========================

This is a fork of [Keyzen by wwwtyro](https://github.com/wwwtyro/keyzen), modified for learning the [Mini-ryoku](https://github.com/ChuseCubr/mini-ryoku) keyboard layout.

The key sequence focuses on learning the Colemak home row, then gradually introduces keys in the top and bottom rows. Common punctuation and web navigation characters are added to the mix after learning every lowercase letter. Alpha letters and uncommon punctuation marks are added last.

Keyzen automatically adds new characters to the mix as your errors decrease. Click on the character sequence at the top to increase or decrease difficulty.

## Order of chars to learn
To simplify the learning the next key is picked with the following system
1. Left - right hand is alternating
2. Homerow from inside to outside
3. below - above homerow is alternating

## sequence strategy

1. New char and from first to current char
2. New char and chars with lowest confidence
3. New char and any char
